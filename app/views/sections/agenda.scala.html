    <ul>
        <li>Who can program in Scala?</li>
        <li>Who has heard of Type Level Programming before?</li>
        <li>Who has done or played around with Type Level Programming?</li>

      - the goal is to give you a feeling for type level programming
      - how do you need to rewire your brain
      - what can it do for you

    <h2> How we will learn </h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>We will always start at the Value Level</li>
    	<li>Then we will translate it to the Type Level</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;"> What we will learn </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First Steps: A type level Boolean Type</li>
        <li>Advanced: A type level Numeric Type</li>
        <li>Doing something useful : Solve our List Problem </li>
        <!-- Complement Value Level <br/> Programming with Type Level Programming -->
    </ul>
    @notesMd{
    	* value level == normal programming
        * translate the implementation to the Type Level by applying a simple set of rules
        * you will see that it is not that different from normal value level programming
    	
    	* Boolean == Hello World of Type Level Programming
    	* Numeric Type == Recursion at the Type Level
    	* Finally doing something useful: We will solve our initial problem by enhancing our List with some Type Level goodness
	}
