    <h2>I would like to know my audience!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Who can program in Scala?</li>
        <li>Who has heard of Type Level Programming before?</li>
        <li>Who has done or played around with Type Level Programming?</li>
    </ul>
    @notesMd {
        * the goal is to give you a feeling for type level programming
        * how do you need to rewire your brain
        * what can it do for you

    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the general idea?</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="/assets/images/motivation_general_types.png" />
    @notesMd{
        * Currently we are not getting the most out of our compilers. We rely mostly on simple type checking. For example we are not allowed to pass an Int to a method, which takes a String. 
        * As type level programmers we want to catch more potential errors at compile time instead of runtime.
        * Not just if we put in a number or sequence of characters. We want to add useful metadata to our code.

    <h2> Our Problem for today</h2>
    <img src="/assets/images/motivation_our_problem.png" />
    @notesMd {
        * we see 2 lists that both contain 2 ints
        * This is a custom List implementation only for Integers. It defines the method '+' which adds the elements of each list and produces a new list.
        * can only work if the lists have the same size
        * throws an Exception if the lists don't have the same size
        * But we can clearly see that we trying to add a 2 element list and a 1 element list. That can never work. The compiler should spot that error for us!

        * at the end of the talk we will have enhanced this implementation so this does not compile at all

    <h2> How we will learn </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We will always start at the Value Level</li>
        <li>Then we will translate it to the Type Level</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;"> What we will learn </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First Steps: A type level Boolean Type</li>
        <li>Advanced: A type level Numeric Type</li>
        <li>Doing something useful : Solve our List Problem </li>
        <!-- Complement Value Level <br/> Programming with Type Level Programming -->
    </ul>
    @notesMd{
        * value level == normal programming
        * translate the implementation to the Type Level by applying a simple set of rules
        * you will see that it is not that different from normal value level programming
        
        * Boolean == Hello World of Type Level Programming
        * Numeric Type == Recursion at the Type Level
        * Finally doing something useful: We will solve our initial problem by enhancing our List with some Type Level goodness
